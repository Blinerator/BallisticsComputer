This repo is the software side of my "potato" cannon.  The goal of the project is to calculate the trajectory of a projectile given the distance and elevation of the target, along with all relevant information regarding the projectile.  The trajectory information will be used to adjust the elevation of the cannons barrel and place shots accurately on target out to 250m.
Most of the calculations are done on a laptop, with an arduino used as a relay between the cannons sensors and the laptop.
